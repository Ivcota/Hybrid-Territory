# README

Welcome to the territory management application! This is a fullstack application built with RedwoodJS, a framework that combines the power of React, GraphQL, and TypeScript to create modern web applications.

Our application is designed to make it easier to manage territories during hybrid activities. To achieve this, we use a variety of technologies including Prisma for database management, GraphQL Yoga for server-side GraphQL execution, Apollo Client for efficient data management in the frontend, and PosgresQL as our database.

With this stack, we are able to create a powerful and efficient application that helps users manage their territories with ease.
